Q1.

Overfitting


Q2.

Lower AIC is better


Q3.

The first model. It isn't overfit


Q4.

Potentially overfitting. The rmse should be higher on the test dataset


Q5.

A dataset is split into k equal parts. 1 of the parts is used as the validation
set, and all the other parts are used as the training set. It is then repeated
for each individual part being the validation set. The average performance is 
then calculated for each set. 


Q6

A validation set is what you used your trained model on to test it. The 
validation set is used to choose the best performing model



Q7

Backwards selection works by selecting every possible feature in a model and 
removing them one by one until the optimal model is reached. The model is
validated at each step.


Q8

Best subset selection searches trhough every possible combination of features in 
a model to find which model is the optimal choice.
